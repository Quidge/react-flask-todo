This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Coming along with CRA are `npm start`, `npm test`, `npm run build`, and `npm run eject`. Read up on those in the CRA documentation if needed.

The app uses [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) because I like writing CSS super close the JS.
